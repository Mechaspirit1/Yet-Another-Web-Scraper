# Web-scraper
a CLI web scapper app in python

# Rationality
This app is beign made with the express intent of learning how to better use python to interact
both with the web and the linux file system, and a way for me as a studant to gather data independently.
There is no malicious intent at play here and i do not condone the use of this software for illegal gathering
of information.

# Functionality
the app will be divided into a couple of different modes:
* Mode 1 - parses the HTML of a webpage and allows the user to write it's contents to a file
* Mode 2 - Allows for the search of keywords and terms within the contents of the parsed HTML

said modes will also be made acessible through the use of command line arguments
